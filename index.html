    <h2>An Introduction to Olympic National Park</h2>
    
        <p>On June 29, 1938, Olympic National Park was founded by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. This park's influence is distinct from many of the United States' other famous national parks, as three very distinct ecosystems can be found within the park. The includes the Olympic Mountain Range, old-growth temperate rainforests, and miles of ocean coastline as well. Due to the extensively different ecosystems, there are so many different things for park visitors to see. Therefore, this website lists just some of the things to do and see at the vast Olympic National Park.</p>
        
  
    <h2>The National Park Service</h2>
    <p>The National Park Service was founded in 1916. Since the creation of the park service, park rangers have worked to uphold and protect the lands in which they are sworn to serve, while also educating and providing recreation for park visitors. Because of this, the park service provides websites with information for every single one of the parks and lands within their jurisdiction. Here is a link to the official Olympic National Park website with the most up to date information on the park. <a href="https://www.nps.gov/olym/index.htm">OlympicNPS.gov</a></p>

    <h5><i>The Olympic Mountains...</i></h5>
    <p>The Olympic Mountains contain some of the best views at the park with one of the most breathtaking overlooks on Hurricane Ridge, where both the mountains and the ocean can be seen. The highest mountain in the range, Mount Olympus, stands at 7,979 feet tall. Here is a photograph of Mount Olympus at the top of the Hurricane Ridge Overlook.</p>

    <h5><i>The Rainforests...</i></h5>
    <p>There are two old-growth rainforests located at Olympic National Park. The larger one, The Hoh Rainforest, receives about 12 feet of rain every year and is home to a large variety of mosses, fungi, and other plants that depend on long rainy seasons as their way of life. This is one of the most popular destinations to see at the park, and lines to get into the rainforest area of the park can take over an hour on busy days. Here is a photograph of some of the trees and ferns found in the rainforest. </p>
