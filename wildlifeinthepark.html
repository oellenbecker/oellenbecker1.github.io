    <h2><b>1. Olympic Marmots</b></h2>
      <dt><b>Olympic marmots can be found in the meadows of the Olympic Mountain Range. These friendly rodents are about the size of a regular housecat and have a bushy tail as well. Marmots prefer to eat fresh and flowering plants, such as glacier lillies, which can be found within the higher elevations at the park. Visitors hoping to see this friendly species usually are able to see marmots along the hike to Hurricane Ridge or at the other locations at higher elevations within the park. </b></dt>

    <h2><b>2. Roosevelt Elk</b></h2>
        <dt><b>This charismatic species was named after President Theodore Roosevelt upon his discovery of the western elk herds. As of today, Olympic National Park holds the largest unmanaged herd of Roosevelt Elk within North America. Because they feed mainly on ferns and low-lying plants, the Hoh Rainforest is the best place to spot this species within the park, especially during September during their annual mating season.</b></dt> 
    <br>
    <h2><b>3. Sea Otters</b></h2>
        <dt><b>Along the coastline of the park, sea otters currently are thriving with nearly 800 otters living off the coast of the park. In the early 1900s, this species was hunted to extiction in the Pacific Northwest, but with reintroduction efforts in 1970, the population has grown back to healthy levels and is now a crowd favorite species to view for the visitors of the park.</b></dt>
