    <h2><b>1. Hoh Rainforest River Trail</b></h2>
      <dt><b>This trail takes visitors through the heart of the old-growth temperate rainforests that the park is so well-known for. This 10.6 mile hike takes a full day, but is well-worth the hike as Wildlife sightings along the trail are frequent, with Roosevelt elk roaming the area freely foraging for food. The hall of mosses area is also located along the trail, showing some of the finest water-loving mosses seen throughout the United States itself.</b></dt>
    <br>
    <h2><b>2. Hurricane Ridge Trail</b></h2>
        <dt><b>This three mile trail takes vistors up a large hill full of switchbacks with views on both sides. Black-tailed deer can be seen along the trail as visitors make their way up with ravens soaring overhead. At the top of the hill, a panoramic view can be seen with the Olympic Mountains, including a pristine view of Mount Olympus, on one side, and a view of the Pacific Ocean can be seen on the other side.</b></dt>
    <br>
    <h2><b>3. Rialto Beach Walk</b></h2>
        <dt><b>This four mile, round-trip, walk along the beach coastline allows visitors to see the wonderous Olympic National Park ocean coastline with views of the vast amount of wildlife that lives near the beach as well. While walking, visitors may find tide pools full of small sea creatures, watch the brown pelicans dive for fish, or possibly even see the head of a seal poking out of the water to catch its breath.</b></dt>
